        - Learned OCaml by creating Snake and then extended it significantly by adding a leaderboard, home screen, multiplayer version and then made it into a client-server distributed system.
        - Created a trading bot that partook in an electronic trading challenge (ETC) where bonds, ETFs, and American Depository Receipts (ADRs) were traded. Strategies I implemented were hedging and fading based on fair values that my bot estimated
        - Extended the Quickcheck library, which allows one to create quick unit-tests. The library has generators, which return random data to write tests; shrinkers, which when a test fails, finds a smaller counterexample; and observers, which are generators but for higher-order functions. I implemented all three for functional queues and deques, lazy strings, and error messages.
