        - The goal of the project was to classify light curves (measurement of photon/sec) of supernovae (exploding stars) in real time.
        - Thus, I first created and trained a variational autoencoder that reduces the data needed to classify the light curve and then I trained a random forest classifier that takes in the encoded version of the data as features and classifies that.
        - With the validation dataset, I managed to get a 74% accuracy rate and reduced the dimension of the data from a 269x4 matrix to a 30x1 matrix.
